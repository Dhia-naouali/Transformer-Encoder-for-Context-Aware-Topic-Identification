# Transformer Encoder for Context-Aware Topic Identification

## Overview
This project implements a **Transformer-based encoder** for identifying topics from textual data. Unlike traditional methods, this approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships within the input text, improving the precision and adaptability of topic classification tasks.


## Model Architecture
The model is inspired by the Transformer encoder architecture:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures contextual relationships across the input sequence.
- **Position-Wise Feedforward Layer**: Refines encoded information for better classification.
- **Classification Head**: Maps encoded features to topic categories.
